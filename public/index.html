				Anyone who’s done boxing training will tell you this is one of the
				hardest of hardcore workouts there is – incredible cardio, strength,
				endurance, and coordination. Muay Thai is the hottest boxing style
				around, so there’s never been a better time to take it up.

			Learn To Play An Instrument: It’s one of the most commonly cited
			activities for helping increase IQ. And there’s evidence that playing
			music changes the structure and function of the brain, with parts of your
			grey matter that control memory, hearing and motor skills becoming more
			active. Plus, playing ‘Sweet Child Of Mine’ on the accordion is quite the
			party piece. <img src="/images/hobbies-guitar.jpg" alt="playing the guitar" />

Old-school cameras are still superior in natural light for authentic-looking photographs. Plus, by having to get it right, you skip all the time you spend dropping filters or fiddling in post-production apps on your phone. You have to be in the moment.
